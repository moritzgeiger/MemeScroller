# Project
To make your visit at our toilet more enjoyable and entertaining we have designed the ultimate meme scroller device.
While sitting on the potty the user can simply scroll through a selection of golden memes of the internet -- without having to usee the internet. 

# Tools
- An old Edradour SFTC Whisky box serves as a framework. 
- The memes are illegally downloaded then hosted on white paper visualized with a cheap HP ink printer then glued together to a long strip. 
- A total of 10 Frames are displayed with a rate of .5 FPS.
- The system is running on a very stable two-pencil-rail.

# Versions
- Maintanance is quite lethargic on this app.
- Depending on the international meme community and their creativeness there might be updates on the meme selection.
